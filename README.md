Enhancement Plan for README.md
Goal Description
The current 
README.md
 describes an "Auction App Frontend" and does not reflect the actual "Dilshan Portfolio" project. The goal is to replace it with a comprehensive and professional README that accurately represents the portfolio project, its features, technologies, and deployment details.

Proposed Changes
Project Root
[MODIFY] 
README.md

Key Features:
Responsive, Modern UI with Tailwind CSS.
3D Interactive Elements using React Three Fiber.

Project Showcase and Skills sections.
Contact form integration (EmailJS).
Technologies Used:
React 19
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
Framer Motion

Node.js (Development environment)
Live Demo: https://dilshan-my-portfolio.netlify.app/
Getting Started:

portfolioData.ts
).
Verification Plan
Manual Verification
Preview: I will use the view_file tool to inspect the generated 
README.md
 to ensure formatting and content are correct.
